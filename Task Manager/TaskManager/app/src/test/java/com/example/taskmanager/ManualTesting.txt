Manual Testing

1. When using google authentication I manually check that you can get the user's email and name after signing in
2. In the first screen, there is a listView containing a custom adapter I had to create. I had to test that the tasks shows the same values as the ones in the database.
3. Tested clicking on a task and calling the correct wrapper method in order to complete or delete it. Then checked the database if that was correct.
4. Tested going to different screens and also passing the correct values to the screens.
5. Tested both boolean values when adding a friend. If the friend is in the database, it would create a message saying add friend and if it did not, it would show that user does not exist.
6. Tested when adding a friend, the user gets added to the pending friend request column in the database
7. Tested when confirming a friend request, both users appear in each respective's friends column in the database
8. Tested when creating a Task, if the wrong type input occurs or if a necessary field is not filled out, a message will appear letting the user know what they need to fill out.
9. Made sure that when creating tasks, it appears correctly in the database.
10. Made sure that when retrieving the task from the database, the correct information gets sent back.
